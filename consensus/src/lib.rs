// - run_view assumes one type of consensus, but should be agnostic of the consensus type for all types of consensus
// - avoid copy-pasta task running code
// what should consensus do?
// - run views
// - handle messages
// - have overarching struct for shared state
// - what is currently called consensusapi we keep as an interface into consensus
//   that, regardless of the type of consensus, must do
//   - take things from the network
